# config-base

C++ single-header library that provides a generic interface for configs.

## Usage

To see an usage example, look at the `example` directory. It contains an implementation for alt-log config files and TOML config files.

## Why

This library provides a generic interface that is reusable for all kinds of configs, making it possible to allow users
to specify configs in different formats, but the developers not having to write code for every single format.
